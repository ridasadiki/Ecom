## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing)
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container)
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations)
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues)
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting)

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
